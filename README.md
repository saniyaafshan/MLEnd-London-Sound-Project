# MLEnd-London-Sound-Project
Machine Learning Mini Project (ECS7020P)

The mini-project has two separate components:

1. Basic component : Using the MLEnd London Sounds dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input an audio segment and predicts whether the audio segment has been recorded indoors or outdoors. (ECS7020P_miniproject_basic.ipynb)
2. Advanced component : Formulate your own machine learning problem and build a machine learning solution using the MLEnd London Sounds dataset. (ECS7020P_miniproject_advanced.ipynb)
 
Components of the Project :

1. Problem Formulation
2. Machine Learning Pipeline
3. Transformation Stage
4. Modelling
5. Methodology
6. Dataset
7. Results
8. Conclusions
